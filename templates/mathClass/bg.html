        In this experiment, we are trying to test how teachers evaluate student ability- and what factors play a role in their decisions. To do this, we use data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study: Kindergarten Class of 2010-11 (hereafter ECLS).

        The ECLS is a longitudinal dataset commissioned by the National Center 
        for Education Statistics (NCES), that tracks a nationally representative 
        sample of over 18000 children from kindergarten through fifth grade. 
        he sample of students was chosen from the incoming kindergarten cohort of 
        2010-11, for both public and private schools. The study also incorporates 
        information on the children's teachers, parents, and care-providers. 
        Information on children is collected through a combination of direct 
        cognitive assessments, detailed questionnaires for children, their teachers, 
        their parents and care-providers, and from school-level administrative data. 
        The variables cover a wide scope of topics, from childrenâ€™s cognitive abilities 
        to indicators of social, physical, and psychological development. It also includes
        subjective and objective evaluations of each student, 
        by different teachers through the child's progress from kindergarten to fifth grade.
