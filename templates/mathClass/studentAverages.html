                    Student Averages
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We are four months into first grade, and your 25 students have recently taken a standardized mid-term test, administered nationally for a representative sample of over 4000 students (under the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study).
                    <br>Weâ€™re in the process of collecting the scores for your 25 students. We have some summary statistics for the entire sample: 
                    <br><br>Mean: 51.64/100
                    <br>Median: 51/100
                    <br>5% to 95% Range: 31/100-71/100
                    <br><br>In the meanwhile, let us play a guessing game. Please guess the average scores for each of the following groups in those 4000+ students (not just for your classroom). You are paid according to how close your guesses are to the actual average for each group:
